  documentation for future readers.

  Remember to:
    - Give enough context: what's the issue? have data to back it?
    - Explain the solution: how you pretend to fix it, highlighting non-obvious traits of the PR

  Feel free to add lists, insert documentation links, cite authors, refer to other Pull Requests.
