**Kubernetes Multi-Deployment Automation with GitHub Actions**

This project automates the deployment and verification of multiple Kubernetes deployments using GitHub Actions. It streamlines the CI/CD pipeline by managing container deployments across various environments, ensuring each deployment succeeds while providing real-time feedback.

**Project Overview**

The primary goal of this project is to simplify and automate multi-deployment operations in Kubernetes by leveraging GitHub Actions. By defining Kubernetes deployments in a structured YAML configuration, this project allows developers to control deployment lifecycles in a consistent, reliable, and scalable manner. The automated checks and rollouts reduce human error and accelerate deployment cycles.

**Key Technologies**

-  **GitHub Actions**: Orchestrates the automation workflows for continuous integration and deployment. It triggers actions, deploys updates, and verifies the status of each deployment in Kubernetes.

-  **Kubernetes (k8s)**: The orchestrator that manages containerized applications across clusters, handling automated deployment, scaling, and operations.

-  **AWS IAM & EKS**: Uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for secure access, and Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) as the Kubernetes management service.

-  **AWS Secrets Manager**: Secures sensitive data such as Kubernetes configuration and AWS credentials.

-  **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerizes the application and its dependencies, making it easy to manage, deploy, and test in isolated environments.

**How to Use in GitHub Actions**

**Step 1: Configure AWS and Kubernetes Access**

1.  **AWS Credentials**:

Store AWS credentials as GitHub secrets to access AWS resources and manage Kubernetes clusters in EKS. Go to **Settings** > **Secrets** in your GitHub repository and add:

-  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID -- Your AWS Access Key.

-  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY -- Your AWS Secret Access Key.

-  AWS_REGION -- The region where your EKS cluster is hosted.

If using AWS roles, define:

-  AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME -- ARN of the role to assume.

2.  **Kubeconfig for Kubernetes Access**:

-  Base64 encode your kubeconfig and save it as a GitHub secret named KUBE_CONFIG.

-  Example command to base64 encode: cat kubeconfig | base64.

**Step 2: Add the Workflow to GitHub Actions**

In your repository, create a new file in .github/workflows/deployment.yml to define the deployment process. Below is a sample GitHub Actions workflow:
